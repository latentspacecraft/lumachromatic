> An exploration of color and harmony, to be used with the Lumatone isomorphic keyboard. **Work in progress.**

This is a work in progress tool for creating key mappings for the [Lumatone](https://lumatone.io) isomorphic keyboard.

More details coming soon...

## Install & Run

Eventually it'll just be a webpage you can click on. But until I get that sorted out, you can run it locally with node.js.

Clone this repo and cd into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/latentspacecraft/lumachromatic
cd lumachromatic
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
